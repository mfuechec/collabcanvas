# CollabCanvas Deployment

## Quick Reference

### Deploy to Production
```bash
./deploy-production.sh
```
- **URL**: https://collabcanvas-5b9fb.web.app
- **Deploys**: Hosting + Security rules (Firestore & Realtime Database)
- **Purpose**: Public production site

### Deploy to Beta
```bash
./deploy-beta.sh
```
- **URL**: `https://collabcanvas-5b9fb--beta-[UNIQUE_ID].web.app`
- **Get URL**: `firebase hosting:channel:open beta`
- **Deploys**: Hosting only (uses same database as production)
- **Purpose**: Testing before production
- **Expires**: 30 days (redeploy to extend)

## Deployment Scripts

Both scripts are located in the project root:
- `deploy-production.sh` - Production deployment
- `deploy-beta.sh` - Beta channel deployment

Both scripts are executable and handle:
- Firebase CLI verification
- Authentication check
- Environment variable verification
- Build process
- Deployment

## Important Notes

1. **Same Database**: Beta and production use the **same** Firestore and Realtime Database
2. **Security Rules**: Only deployed with production (beta inherits them)
3. **Testing Workflow**: Always test on beta before deploying to production
4. **No User Input Required**: Scripts are fully automated

## Firebase Project

- **Project ID**: collabcanvas-5b9fb
- **Configuration**: `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json`
