## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Layout
- **Top Navigation Bar** - App title, welcome message, presence indicators, theme toggle, sign out
- **Floating Panels** - Canvas info (top-left) and toolbar (near info panel)
- **Glass Effect Design** - Semi-transparent panels with backdrop blur
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to different screen sizes

### Canvas Features
- **5000x5000px Canvas** - Large workspace with boundary enforcement
- **12% Initial Zoom** - Shows full canvas on load
- **Visual Feedback** - Shape selection, locking indicators, drawing preview
- **Theme Adaptation** - Canvas background differentiates in light/dark modes

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate test coverage report

### Code Style & Patterns
- **CSS Variables** - Used for reliable theming (preferred over Tailwind classes)
- **Error Boundaries** - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States** - Visual feedback for all async operations
- **Optimistic Updates** - Instant UI feedback before server confirmation
- **Separation of Concerns** - Services, hooks, contexts, components clearly separated
- **Custom Hooks** - Encapsulate complex logic (Firebase sync, presence, cursors)
- **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Database Strategy
- **Firestore**: Persistent canvas state (shapes, metadata)
  - Server timestamps for conflict resolution (last-write-wins)
  - Object locking with 5-minute timeout
  - Optimistic updates with server confirmation
- **Realtime Database**: High-frequency ephemeral data (cursors, drag/drawing previews, presence)
  - Sub-50ms updates for smooth real-time experience
  - Automatic cleanup via `onDisconnect()` handlers

### Conflict Resolution
- **Last-Write-Wins**: Firestore timestamps resolve simultaneous edits
- **Lock-on-Select**: Prevents concurrent edits to same shape
- **Visual Feedback**: Red border shows locked shapes
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant local feedback, server sync in background

### Performance Strategy
- **Viewport Culling**: Only render visible shapes (tested with 500+ objects)
- **Throttled Updates**: Cursor updates limited to 30 FPS
- **Smart Re-renders**: useMemo/useCallback prevent unnecessary React renders
- **Efficient State**: shapesMap for O(1) lookups vs array searches

## 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Authentication
**Issue**: Google sign-in popup gets blocked
- **Solution**: Allow popups in browser settings for the domain
- **Alternative**: Use email/password authentication

### Canvas
**Issue**: Tailwind classes not applying consistently in some environments
- **Workaround**: Using CSS variables with inline styles for critical UI elements

### Performance
- **Tested**: 500+ shapes with viewport culling maintains 60 FPS
- **Network**: Optimized with throttled cursor updates (30 FPS) and retry logic
- **Memory**: Automatic cleanup of disconnected users and expired locks

### Firebase
**Issue**: "Permission denied" errors
- **Solution**: Ensure Firestore/RTDB rules allow authenticated read/write
- **Check**: Verify user is properly authenticated before canvas operations

## 🚀 Live Demo

**🌐 [Try CollabCanvas Live](https://collabcanvas-5b9fb.web.app)**

Experience real-time collaborative editing with multiple users:
- Open the link in multiple browser tabs/windows
- Sign in with different accounts (or use Google sign-in)
- Create and move shapes to see real-time synchronization
- Watch cursors and presence indicators update live

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Setup
The app is deployed on Firebase Hosting with the following architecture:
- **Frontend**: React SPA hosted on Firebase Hosting
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- **Database**: 
  - Firestore for persistent canvas state (shapes, metadata)
  - Realtime Database for live updates (cursors, presence)
- **Security**: Production-ready Firestore and Database security rules

### Quick Deploy

**Deploy to Beta (for testing)**
```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy-beta.sh
# Get beta URL: firebase hosting:channel:open beta
```

**Deploy to Production**
```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy-production.sh
# Live at: https://collabcanvas-5b9fb.web.app
```

Both scripts handle build, authentication, and deployment automatically. See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for details.

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login and configure**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase use --add  # Select or create Firebase project
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `ENV_SETUP.md` instructions
   - Create `.env` with your Firebase config
   - Update `.firebaserc` with your project ID

4. **Deploy using scripts**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to beta for testing
   ./scripts/deploy/deploy-beta.sh
   
   # Deploy to production when ready
   ./scripts/deploy/deploy-production.sh
   ```

### Environment Variables for Production
- Create production Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- Enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- Create Firestore Database (production mode)
- Create Realtime Database (production mode)
- Update `.env` with production Firebase config (see `ENV_SETUP.md`)
- Deploy security rules before first deployment

## 🧪 Testing

### Rubric Testing Scenarios

**Real-Time Synchronization**
- [ ] Sub-100ms object sync verification
- [ ] Sub-50ms cursor sync verification
- [ ] Zero visible lag during rapid multi-user edits

**Conflict Resolution**
- [ ] Simultaneous Move: Two users drag same shape simultaneously
- [ ] Rapid Edit Storm: Multiple users edit same object rapidly
- [ ] Delete vs Edit: User deletes while another edits
- [ ] Create Collision: Two users create objects at identical timestamps

**Persistence & Reconnection**
- [ ] User refreshes mid-drag → position preserved
- [ ] All users disconnect → canvas persists fully
- [ ] Network drop (30s+) → auto-reconnects with complete state
- [ ] Operations during disconnect queue and sync on reconnect

**Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] 500+ objects at 60 FPS
- [ ] 5+ concurrent users without degradation
- [ ] Smooth interactions at scale

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] **Multi-user Testing** - 2-5 concurrent users creating/moving shapes
- [x] **Performance** - 500+ shapes with smooth interactions (viewport culling)
- [x] **Persistence** - Shapes remain after browser close/reopen
- [x] **Cross-browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- [ ] **Network Issues** - Offline/online transitions, connection failures

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for core services (auth, canvas, presence)
- Component tests for UI interactions  
- Hook tests for state management
- Error handling and edge case coverage
