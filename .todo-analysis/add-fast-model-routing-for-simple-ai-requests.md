## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src/contexts/CanvasModeContext.jsx - This file likely manages different modes of the canvas, which could include routing logic for different AI models.
- src/contexts/CanvasContext.jsx - This file probably handles the main canvas operations and interactions, where request complexity detection might be integrated.
- src/utils/shapes/validation.js - This file might contain logic to validate shape requests, which could be extended to include complexity detection.
- src/utils/shapes/rendering.js - This file is relevant for understanding how shapes are rendered, which might influence the routing decision based on complexity.
- src/utils/constants.js - This file could contain constants that define thresholds or parameters for complexity detection.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves implementing a new routing mechanism based on request complexity, which requires understanding and modifying existing context and utility files. The complexity lies in accurately detecting request complexity and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems without degrading performance.

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
This feature will improve response times for simple requests, enhancing user experience. However, incorrect complexity detection could lead to inappropriate model usage, affecting response quality for complex tasks.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Analyze existing request handling to identify where complexity detection can be integrated.
2. Develop a complexity detection algorithm based on request parameters.
3. Implement routing logic to direct requests to the appropriate model.
4. Test the routing mechanism with various request scenarios to ensure accuracy.
5. Optimize performance to ensure minimal overhead from complexity detection.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
