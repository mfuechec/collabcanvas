# Implement AI response caching

**Priority:** important  
**Added:** 2025-10-18

## Task Summary

Cache common AI responses (shapes, patterns) to avoid repeated API calls. Store by prompt hash with TTL expiration. 

---

## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src//contexts/CanvasModeContext.jsx - This file likely manages the mode of the canvas, which could be relevant for determining when to cache or retrieve cached responses.
- src//contexts/CanvasContext.jsx - This file is central to the canvas operations and will likely need to interact with the caching mechanism to store and retrieve AI responses.
- src//utils/constants.js - This file may contain constants that could be useful for defining cache-related settings, such as TTL values.
- src//utils/shapes/index.js - This file likely serves as an entry point for shape-related utilities, which are directly related to the AI responses being cached.
- src//utils/shapes/rendering.js - This file handles rendering, which may need to be adjusted to utilize cached responses instead of making API calls.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves integrating a caching mechanism into existing code, which requires understanding the current flow of AI responses and ensuring that caching does not disrupt existing functionality. The complexity is moderate due to the need to manage cache expiration and ensure that the cache is correctly invalidated and updated.

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
Implementing caching can significantly reduce API calls, improving performance and reducing costs. However, incorrect caching could lead to outdated or incorrect responses being used, impacting user experience.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Analyze the current flow of AI responses to identify where caching can be integrated.
2. Implement a caching mechanism using a suitable library or custom solution, storing responses by prompt hash.
3. Set up TTL expiration for cache entries to ensure data freshness.
4. Modify relevant files to check the cache before making API calls.
5. Test the caching mechanism thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce bugs.
6. Monitor performance and adjust TTL or caching strategy as needed.
