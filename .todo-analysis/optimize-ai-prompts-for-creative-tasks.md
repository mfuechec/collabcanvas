## Task Summary

Simplify and restructure creative prompts ("draw sunset", "create galaxy") to reduce token count and processing time while maintaining quality. 

---

## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src//components/AI/AIChat.jsx - This file likely handles the interaction with AI prompts, making it crucial for understanding how prompts are processed and optimized.
- src//services/aiAgent.js.backup - Contains the core logic for AI operations, which may include prompt handling and processing.
- src//services/ai/tools/index.js - This file might include utility functions that could be used for prompt optimization.
- src//services/ai/tools/templates/useLoginTemplate.js - Although specific to login, understanding template usage can provide insights into prompt structuring.
- src//App.jsx - As the main application file, it might provide context on how prompts are integrated into the overall application flow.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves modifying existing logic to optimize AI prompts, which requires a good understanding of the current implementation. The complexity arises from ensuring that prompt simplification does not degrade the quality of AI outputs. Additionally, changes need to be tested thoroughly to ensure they do not introduce new issues.

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
Optimizing AI prompts can significantly improve processing time and reduce costs, enhancing user experience. However, if not done correctly, it could lead to a decrease in the quality of AI-generated content, affecting user satisfaction.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Review the current prompt processing logic in AIChat.jsx and aiAgent.js.backup.
2. Identify and document the current token usage and processing time for various prompts.
3. Develop a strategy for simplifying prompts while maintaining their effectiveness.
4. Implement changes in a separate branch and conduct tests to compare performance and quality.
5. Review and refine the changes based on test results.
6. Deploy the optimized prompts and monitor for any issues.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked by: None
