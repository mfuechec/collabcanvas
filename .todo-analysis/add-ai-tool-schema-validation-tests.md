## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src//services/aiAgent.js.backup - This file likely contains the core logic for AI interactions and will be crucial for implementing schema validation.
- src//services/ai/tools/index.js - This file might manage different AI tools, making it relevant for integrating validation tests.
- src//components/AI/AIChat.jsx - This component likely handles AI responses and user interactions, making it important for testing AI response validation.
- src//services/ai/tools/templates/useLoginTemplate.js - This template file might be used for specific AI responses, relevant for testing schema validation.
- src//hooks/useFirebaseCanvas.js - This file might interact with AI tools and could be relevant for testing how AI responses affect the canvas.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves creating a test suite for AI responses, which requires understanding the existing AI logic and how responses are structured. The complexity arises from ensuring that the tests cover all possible scenarios of partial data and schema validation. Additionally, integrating these tests without disrupting existing functionality adds to the complexity.

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
Ensuring AI responses are validated before reaching production is crucial for maintaining application stability and user trust. Schema validation will prevent incorrect or incomplete AI responses from causing errors or unexpected behavior in the application, which is critical for user experience.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Review the existing AI response structure and identify key validation points.
2. Develop a test suite that covers various scenarios of partial data and schema validation.
3. Integrate the test suite into the existing testing framework and ensure it runs automatically.
4. Validate the tests against different AI tools and templates to ensure comprehensive coverage.
5. Review and refine tests based on initial results and edge cases.
