## Task Summary

Measure and identify bottlenecks in AI creative requests (5-10s delays). Profile aiAgent.js, prompt processing, and API round-trip times to inform optimization strategy. 

---

## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src/services/aiAgent.js.backup - This file is likely the core of AI request handling and will be crucial for profiling bottlenecks.
- src/components/AI/AIChat.jsx - This component likely interfaces with aiAgent.js and could contribute to delays in AI requests.
- src/services/ai/tools/index.js - This file might contain utility functions that are used in processing AI requests.
- src/App.jsx - As the main application file, it might manage the overall flow and timing of requests.
- src/hooks/useFirebaseCanvas.js - This hook might be involved in data fetching or state management that affects request timing.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves profiling and identifying bottlenecks, which requires a good understanding of the codebase and the ability to interpret profiling data. The complexity arises from the need to trace delays across multiple components and services, which may not be straightforward.

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
Optimizing AI request bottlenecks can significantly enhance user experience by reducing delays, leading to faster response times and improved application performance. This is critical for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Set up profiling tools to measure performance metrics in aiAgent.js and related components.
2. Analyze the profiling data to identify specific areas contributing to the 5-10s delays.
3. Investigate API round-trip times and prompt processing for potential optimizations.
4. Implement targeted optimizations based on findings, focusing on the most significant bottlenecks.
5. Test the application to ensure that optimizations have effectively reduced delays without introducing new issues.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked by: None
