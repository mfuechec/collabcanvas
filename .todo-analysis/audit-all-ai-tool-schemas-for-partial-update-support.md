## Task Summary

Review ALL tool schemas (batch_update_shapes, create_shapes, move_shapes, etc). Make only truly required fields required. Apply .optional()/.partial() pattern. Fixes "make it purple" validation bug. 

---

## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src//utils/shapes/validation.js - This file likely contains the validation logic for shape schemas, which is central to the task of auditing and updating schemas for partial update support.
- src//utils/shapes/constants.js - This file may define constants used in shape schemas, which could be relevant for identifying required fields.
- src//contexts/CanvasContext.jsx - This file might interact with shape schemas and could be relevant for understanding how schemas are used in context.
- src//utils/shapes/index.js - This file likely serves as an entry point for shape-related utilities, which may include schema definitions or manipulations.
- src//utils/shapes/rendering.js - This file might use shape schemas for rendering, providing insight into which fields are truly required.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves auditing and potentially modifying multiple schema files, which requires a thorough understanding of the existing validation logic and how schemas are utilized across the application. The complexity arises from ensuring that changes do not introduce new validation bugs or break existing functionality.

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
Correctly implementing partial update support can improve the flexibility and robustness of the application, particularly in scenarios where only specific fields need updating. However, improper changes could lead to validation errors or unexpected behavior, impacting user experience.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Review the current validation logic in `validation.js` to understand how required fields are determined.
2. Identify all schema definitions and their usage across relevant files.
3. Modify schemas to apply the `.optional()`/.partial() pattern where applicable, ensuring only truly required fields remain mandatory.
4. Test changes thoroughly to ensure no new validation bugs are introduced.
5. Document changes and update any relevant documentation or comments in the codebase.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked by: None
