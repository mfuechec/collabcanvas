## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src//services/ai/tools/index.js - This file likely contains the main definitions for AI tools, making it crucial for updating field indicators.
- src//services/ai/tools/templates/useLoginTemplate.js - As a template file, it will need updates to include examples of optional and required fields.
- src//services/ai/tools/templates/useCardTemplate.js - Similar to the login template, this file will need updates for field indicators and examples.
- src//services/ai/tools/templates/useNavbarTemplate.js - Another template file that requires updates for optional and required field indicators.
- src//components/AI/AIChat.jsx - This component may need updates to handle the new field indicators in prompts.

**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Reasoning:**  
The task involves updating multiple files to include new indicators and examples, which requires a good understanding of the existing codebase. The complexity is medium due to the need to ensure consistency across different templates and the potential for unforeseen interactions with other parts of the system.

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Impact Reasoning:**  
This update will improve the clarity of AI tool prompts, potentially leading to more accurate AI-generated plans. However, the impact is medium as it primarily affects the user experience rather than core functionality.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Review the current structure of tool definitions in `src//services/ai/tools/index.js`.
2. Update the tool definitions to include optional and required field indicators.
3. Modify template files (`useLoginTemplate.js`, `useCardTemplate.js`, `useNavbarTemplate.js`) to include examples of partial updates.
4. Test the changes in `src//components/AI/AIChat.jsx` to ensure prompts are correctly interpreted.
5. Conduct thorough testing to verify that the updates do not introduce errors or inconsistencies.
