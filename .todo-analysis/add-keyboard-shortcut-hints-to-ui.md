## Detailed Analysis

**Relevant Files:**
- src//components/Canvas/CanvasToolbar.jsx - This file likely contains the toolbar component where the keyboard shortcut hints need to be added.
- src//utils/designSystem.js - This file may contain styling or utility functions that can be used to ensure the hints are consistent with the existing design system.
- src//components/HelpMenu/HelpMenu.jsx - This file (assumed based on naming convention) would likely contain the help menu where additional shortcut hints should be added.

**Complexity:** LOW  
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 hours  
**Risk Level:** Low

**Reasoning:**
The task involves adding visual hints to existing UI components, which is typically straightforward. The complexity is low because it primarily involves modifying existing components and ensuring the design is consistent. The main challenge might be ensuring the hints are subtle and do not clutter the UI.

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Impact Reasoning:**
Adding keyboard shortcut hints can significantly enhance user experience by making the application more accessible and efficient to use. While it does not introduce new functionality, it improves usability, which can lead to increased user satisfaction and productivity.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Review the existing toolbar and help menu components to identify where hints can be added.
2. Design the visual representation of the hints, ensuring they are subtle and consistent with the design system.
3. Implement the hints in the CanvasToolbar.jsx and HelpMenu.jsx components.
4. Test the changes to ensure they display correctly and do not interfere with existing functionality.
5. Review with the design team to ensure alignment with UI/UX standards.
