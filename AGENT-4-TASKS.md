# Agent 4 Tasks: AI Optimization

## Branch: `feature/agent-4-ai-optimization`

## Task Assignment

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Tasks (2 tasks)
1. **Optimize AI prompts for creative tasks** (10-15 hours)
2. **Add fast model routing for simple AI requests** (12-16 hours)

### ðŸ“‹ Task 1: Optimize AI Prompts for Creative Tasks
- **Status:** Ready to start
- **Estimate:** 10-15 hours
- **Impact:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Details:** Simplify and restructure creative prompts ("draw sunset", "create galaxy") to reduce token count and processing time while maintaining quality.

**Key Files:** `/components/AI/AIChat.jsx`, `/services/aiAgent.js.backup`

### ðŸ“‹ Task 2: Add Fast Model Routing
- **Status:** Ready to start
- **Estimate:** 12-16 hours
- **Impact:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Details:** Route simple shape creation requests to gpt-4o-mini for faster responses. Keep gpt-4o for complex creative tasks. Auto-detect request complexity.

**Key Files:** `contexts/CanvasModeContext.jsx`, `contexts/CanvasContext.jsx`

### âœ… Success Criteria
- [ ] Creative prompts are optimized for speed
- [ ] Model routing works correctly
- [ ] Simple requests use faster model
- [ ] Complex requests use full model
- [ ] Quality maintained while improving speed

### ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. Switch to branch: `git checkout feature/agent-4-ai-optimization`
2. Start with prompt optimization
3. Implement model routing logic
4. Test both simple and complex requests
5. Measure performance improvements
6. Commit and push changes
7. Create PR when ready
