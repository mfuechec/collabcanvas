# Agent 3 Tasks: Performance & Caching

## Branch: `feature/agent-3-performance-caching`

## Task Assignment

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Tasks (2 tasks)
1. **Profile AI request bottlenecks** (8-12 hours)
2. **Implement AI response caching** (10-15 hours)

### ðŸ“‹ Task 1: Profile AI Request Bottlenecks
- **Status:** Ready to start
- **Estimate:** 8-12 hours
- **Impact:** HIGH
- **Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Details:** Measure and identify bottlenecks in AI creative requests (5-10s delays). Profile aiAgent.js, prompt processing, and API round-trip times to inform optimization strategy.

**Key Files:** `services/aiAgent.js.backup`, `components/AI/AIChat.jsx`

### ðŸ“‹ Task 2: Implement AI Response Caching
- **Status:** Ready to start
- **Estimate:** 10-15 hours
- **Impact:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Details:** Cache common AI responses (shapes, patterns) to avoid repeated API calls. Store by prompt hash with TTL expiration.

**Key Files:** `/contexts/CanvasModeContext.jsx`, `/contexts/CanvasContext.jsx`

### âœ… Success Criteria
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified and documented
- [ ] Caching system implemented
- [ ] Performance improvements measured
- [ ] Cache invalidation working properly
- [ ] No memory leaks

### ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. Switch to branch: `git checkout feature/agent-3-performance-caching`
2. Start with profiling to understand current bottlenecks
3. Implement caching based on profiling results
4. Test performance improvements
5. Commit and push changes
6. Create PR when ready
