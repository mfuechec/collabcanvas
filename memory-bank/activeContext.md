## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Disconnect Cleanup (COMPLETED)
**Problem Identified**: When shapes were deleted (especially via undo/redo), their `onDisconnect()` handlers in Firebase RTDB were not being cancelled. This caused hundreds of errors on browser refresh as orphaned handlers tried to unlock non-existent shapes.

**Root Cause**: 
- `deleteShape()` and `batchDeleteShapes()` in `src/services/canvas.js` were not calling `clearDisconnectCleanup()`
- When user did: Create → Delete → Undo → Redo, the shape got deleted twice but handlers accumulated
- On browser refresh, all orphaned handlers fired simultaneously

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// src/services/canvas.js
const deleteShape = async (shapeId, canvasId) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // NEW: Clear disconnect cleanup BEFORE deleting
  await clearDisconnectCleanup(shapeId);
  
  await deleteDoc(shapeRef);
  // ...
};

// Same fix applied to batchDeleteShapes
const batchDeleteShapes = async (shapeIds, canvasId) => {
  // NEW: Clear all handlers before batch delete
  const cleanupPromises = shapeIds.map(shapeId => 
    clearDisconnectCleanup(shapeId)
  );
  await Promise.all(cleanupPromises);
  
  // Then execute batch delete...
};
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ No more "Shape not found" errors on refresh
- ✅ Undo/redo cycles work cleanly
- ✅ No memory leaks from orphaned handlers
- ✅ Proper RTDB cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/canvas.js` - Added `clearDisconnectCleanup()` calls

**Needs**: Deployment to production

### 🧪 E2E Testing Suite (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**:
- Playwright test framework installed and configured
- Test helpers created for canvas interactions
- Comprehensive test coverage:
  - `shape-operations.spec.js` - 10 tests for CRUD operations
  - `undo-redo.spec.js` - 8 tests including critical disconnect cleanup bug
  - `multi-user.spec.js` - 7 tests for real-time collaboration
  - `ai-assistant.spec.js` - 7 tests for AI integration

**Test Helpers**:
- `window.__playwright_getShapeCount()` - Get number of shapes
- `window.__playwright_getShapes()` - Get all shapes
- `window.__playwright_clearAllShapes()` - Clear canvas
- `window.__playwright_createTestShape()` - Create shape programmatically

**Files Created**:
- `playwright.config.js`
- `tests/e2e/*.spec.js`
- `tests/helpers/*.js`
- `E2E_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- Modified `src/App.jsx` - Added test helpers
- Modified `src/components/Layout/LeftSidebar.jsx` - Added data-testid attributes

**Status**: Infrastructure complete, authentication approach pending

**Challenges**:
- Google OAuth doesn't work in headless tests
- User reverted test authentication changes
- Need Firebase emulator setup for CI/CD

**Next Steps for Testing**:
- Either: Set up Firebase Auth emulator
- Or: Manual authentication for local testing
- Or: Mock authentication layer

### 🎨 UI/UX State (Stable)
- Figma-inspired design system with design tokens
- Properties panel always open (user preference)
- Minimap positioned top-left
- AI assistant bottom-right, collapsible
- All keyboard shortcuts working
- Rotation functionality complete with boundary checking

## Active Decisions

### 1. Per-Shape Document Architecture
**Decision**: Each shape is a separate Firestore document in subcollection
**Rationale**: Much faster batch operations, better concurrency
**Trade-off**: More Firestore reads, but performance gain worth it
**Status**: Implemented and deployed

### 2. Test Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Pending user preference
**Options**:
  A. Firebase Auth Emulator (best for CI/CD)
  B. Test mode button (quick local testing)
  C. Manual auth (current state)
**Status**: User exploring options

### 3. Opacity Default Value
**Decision**: New shapes default to 0.8 opacity
**Rationale**: User preference for visual hierarchy
**Status**: Implemented

## Known Issues

### 1. ~~Disconnect Cleanup~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~Issue~~: Orphaned onDisconnect handlers
- ~~Impact~~: Console errors on refresh
- **Status**: FIXED in latest changes

### 2. Test Authentication
- Issue: No automated auth for e2e tests
- Impact: Tests can't run automatically
- Status: Infrastructure ready, auth approach pending

### 3. Firebase Emulator Not Set Up
- Issue: Tests hit production Firebase
- Impact: Not ideal for CI/CD, test data mixes with prod
- Status: Documented in TODO but not critical for now

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Deploy Bug Fix** 🔴 Priority
   - Build application
   - Deploy to Firebase hosting
   - Verify disconnect cleanup works in production

2. **Test Authentication** 🟡 Medium
   - User to decide on approach
   - Options documented in `E2E_TESTING.md`

3. **Run E2E Tests** 🟡 Medium
   - Once auth approach chosen
   - Verify all critical paths

4. **Optional: Firebase Emulator** 🟢 Low
   - Set up for isolated testing
   - Document process
   - Configure for CI/CD
